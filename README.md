# Overview

Challenges in the current healthcare system impede efficient patient care and pose risks for both patients and
healthcare professionals. A major concern is the lack of patient access to medical records, limiting their engagement
in their healthcare journey. The prevalent use of paper-based records further jeopardizes the integrity and security of
sensitive health information. Patients' constrained access hinders informed decision-making, potentially leading
to suboptimal outcomes. On the provider side, reliance on traditional methods like handwritten records consumes
time and introduces error risks. The dependence on memory for recalling patient information also poses risks of
oversight in care delivery. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive solution to enhance patient access, secure
data exchange, and streamline record-keeping for improved healthcare quality. The object of this project is:

1. Implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR): Transitioning from paper-based records to a secure and centralized
EHR system will facilitate efficient patient information storage, retrieval, and exchange. This digital format minimizes the risk of
data loss, enhances accuracy, and ensures the integrity of health records.

2. Patient Portals for Enhanced Access: Introducing user-friendly patient portals connected to the EHR system will empower
patients to access their medical records securely. This access includes information on diagnoses, treatments, medications,
cwand test results, fostering informed decision-making and active patient participation in their healthcare.
